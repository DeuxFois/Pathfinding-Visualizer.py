# PathFiding Visualizer
### A simple PathFiding Visualizer in a grid 

#### How to run ? 
* `python main.py`

### Improvements needed
  * stop calculating the older path when a newer is asked
  * better Random Maze - the algorythme is pretty broken
  * don't destroy start or end cell's tab when the random maze in generating
